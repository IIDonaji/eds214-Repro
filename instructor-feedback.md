# Exceeded spec

## The student has provided attentive, constructive feedback in a peer review

I have given my peer constructive feedback on their reproducible project. With details as to what they have done well and what they should change for example move a script to a appropriate file. 

## The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works

I have added a simple flowchart in my README and a section with instruction on how to reproduce my work with package names and files that will be found in the project. The files are linked to their GitHub page for optional review.  


# Collaborate

My peer participation feedback went well. I tried to be specific on my directions and used visuals and examples to explain the fix.

# Instructor feedback

## Automate

[M] **Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document**

[M] The analysis runs without errors

[M] **The analysis produces the expected output**

[M] **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**

## Organize

[M] Raw data is contained in its own folder

[M] Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

[M] **At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file**

## Document

[M] The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

[M] **The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works**

- Your flowchart is clean and well structured, but too general to exceed the spec. It should be about your analysis specifically.

[M] **The code is appropriately commented**

[M] **Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention**

## Scale

After cloning the repo on Workbench:

[NY] Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages

- I don't see a script that installs the packages needed for your analysis

[M] The analysis script runs without errors

## Collaborate

[E] **The student has provided attentive, constructive feedback in a peer review**

- Thank you for providing such thoughtful feedback!

[M] **The student has contributed to a peer's repo by opening an issue and creating a pull request**

[M] The repo has at least three closed GitHub issues

[M] The commit history includes at least one merged branch and a resolved merge conflict

[M] The rendered analysis is accessible via GitHub Pages
